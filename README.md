# Advanced C Notes

This is my **personal, continuously updated notes** on Advanced C programming.  
It contains explanations, examples, and patterns for real-world usage and interview preparation.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Structures & Unions
- `struct` and `union` basics
- Nested structures
- Structure inside a union and vice versa
- Memory layout and optimization
- When to use `struct` vs `union`

### 2. Pointers
- Basic pointers and pointer arithmetic
- Pointers to structures and unions
- Double pointers
- Function pointers & callbacks
- Pointer-array combinations

### 3. Functions
- Call by value vs call by reference
- Inline functions and `static inline`
- Recursive functions
- Passing arrays, pointers, and structures to functions
- Using function pointers in structures

### 4. Storage Classes
- `extern`, `static`, `register`, `auto`
- Variable scope, lifetime, and linkage
- Multi-file project usage

### 5. Macros & Preprocessor
- `#define` constants and macros
- Conditional compilation: `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#elif`, `#endif`
- Include guards
- Debugging & configuration using preprocessor directives

### 6. Advanced Combinations
- Struct + pointer
- Union + pointer
- Function pointer + struct
- Inline + static + extern
- Macros with conditional compilation
